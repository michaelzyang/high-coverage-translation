# STAPLE 2020 README

Welcome to the Duolingo 2020 Shared Task on Simultaneous Translation And Paraphrase for Language Education (STAPLE)!

## Data

There are five folders, one for each language. Each folder contains two files: 1) the shared task gold data (example, train.en_vi.2020-01-13.gold.txt) and 2) the AWS translation baseline (example, train.en_vi.aws_baseline.pred.txt).

Starter code (including a scoring script) is available at this repository: https://github.com/duolingo/duolingo-sharedtask-2020/

Good luck!
